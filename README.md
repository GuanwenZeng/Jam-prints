# Jam-prints

Code and data:
The codes and data are used for the article named "Unveiling City Jam-prints of Urban Traffic based on Jam Patterns", which consist of two parts. One part (coded by C++) is used for identifying jam trees, the other part (coded by Python) is used for analyzing characteristics of jam trees.

(1) Identifying jam trees (C++)
You may directly open the Jamprints.vcxproj file if you have installed Visual Studio 2022 software, or refer to the Source.cpp if you use other IDE. The format of input data and output results of this code can be referred by the demo cases in file "input files" and file "demo results" respectively.

(2) Analyzing characteristics of jam trees (Python)
You may refer to "main.py", "trees.py" and "fitting_func.py", which could be run based on interpreter of version Python 3.7. The raw data is not published while the processed data (processed from raw data by the above C++ code) of each area in the article is uploaded in the file "area results", which are the inputs of this code. Before running the code for a certain area, you should adjust the file path and tune parameters when necessary for this area.
